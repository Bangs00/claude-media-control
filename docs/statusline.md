# Now-playing in your statusline

**English** | [한국어](statusline.ko.md) | [日本語](statusline.ja.md) | [简体中文](statusline.zh-CN.md)

Show the current track as an extra line in Claude Code's statusline:

```
[your existing statusline, untouched]
▶︎ Karma Police — Radiohead  ━━━━━━────  2:13/4:24
```

The segment comes from `media.sh statusline`, which answers from a small TTL
cache (default 1s) in well under 50ms — it never slows your statusline down.
The real now-playing read runs at most once per TTL window, so the elapsed
time and progress bar advance about once a second when the statusline redraws.

## Design guarantees (why this is safe to add)

1. Your existing statusline command is **not replaced** — the wrapper runs it
   first, exactly as it was.
2. Its output passes through **byte-for-byte unmodified**.
3. Now-playing is only ever **appended as its own line**.
4. With `display.statusline` off (the default) the segment command prints
   nothing — not even an empty line. Claude Code collapses the missing line,
   so your statusline looks exactly like before.

The plugin never edits `settings.json` for you; everything below is a manual,
reversible edit.

## Step 1 — enable the segment

Inside Claude Code:

```
/media:config display.statusline on
```

(Enabling verifies a working now-playing read path first; if it is refused,
run `/media:doctor`.)

### Arrange what the segment shows

Run `/media:statusline` to arrange the segment. The picker shows the
Standard / Stacked presets as visual previews. `Custom…` takes a numeric
pattern typed straight into the chat, built from this legend:

| # | item | looks like |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `track` | `▶︎ Karma Police — Radiohead` |
| 2 | `app` | `(Spotify)` |
| 3 | `volume` | `🔉 ▄ 45%` — icon + level bar + percent; `🔇` when muted |
| 4 | `progressbar` | `━━━━━━────` |
| 5 | `time` | `2:13/4:24` |
| 6 | `output` | `🎧 AirPods Pro` — icon by device kind: `🎧` Bluetooth/headphones · `📺` HDMI/DisplayPort · `📶` AirPlay · `🔊` speakers |

Digit order is display order. `/` starts a new line. A digit you leave out
hides that item. So `123/456` puts track, app and volume on line 1 and the
rest on line 2. The default set is `track app progressbar time`; a quick
preset picker also opens inside `/media:config`.

How the layout behaves:

- **Order** — items render in exactly the order they are saved. Ask for
  "time first", or set the list directly:
  `/media:config statusline.fields "time,progressbar,track,app"`.
- **Explicit lines** — a `/` in the field list starts a new line. Each line
  then shows exactly the items you put there, in that order. A line with
  nothing to show disappears (e.g. `output` without the native helper).
- **Grouped layout** (no `/` in the list) — one line, or one line per group
  with `statusline.multiline on`. The groups: `app` attaches to the track;
  `progressbar` and `time` pair up when adjacent; `output` and `volume`
  join an adjacent track group, and pair up with each other when adjacent.

Standard — one line with all items (pattern `123456`):

```
▶︎ Karma Police — Radiohead (Spotify)  🔉 ▄ 45%  ━━━━━━────  2:13/4:24  🎧 AirPods Pro
```

Stacked — two explicit lines (pattern `123/456`, i.e.
`statusline.fields "track,app,volume,/,progressbar,time,output"`):

```
▶︎ Karma Police — Radiohead (Spotify)  🔉 ▄ 45%
━━━━━━────  2:13/4:24  🎧 AirPods Pro
```

Output on the track's line, no volume (pattern `126/45`):

```
▶︎ Karma Police — Radiohead (Spotify)  🎧 AirPods Pro
━━━━━━────  2:13/4:24
```

Time first, one line (pattern `5412`, i.e.
`statusline.fields "time,progressbar,track,app"`):

```
2:13/4:24  ━━━━━━────  ▶︎ Karma Police — Radiohead (Spotify)
```

The `output` and `volume` items need the native helper (they ride the same
read as the rest of the segment, so they add no extra cost). Switch devices
with `/media:output`, change the level with `/media:volume`; the segment
updates on the next tick.

### Long titles: marquee scrolling

Titles wider than 30 terminal cells scroll through a fixed 30-cell window,
one character per second. (The window advances on every redraw — see the
1-second refresh below.)

```
▶︎ ing Willow (10 Minute Version)  — Taylor Swift (Music)
```

CJK characters count as two cells, so the window stays steady for Korean,
Japanese, and Chinese titles. Prefer the full title, however long? Turn it
off:

```
/media:config statusline.marquee off
```

### Colors & per-item styles

The segment ships styled by default — Claude Code statuslines render ANSI
codes, and the wrapper below passes them through untouched:

- icon and the filled part of the progress bar follow the playback state
  (green playing, yellow paused)
- **bold** title and elapsed time (the moving part stays readable), *italic*
  artist, dimmed total time, empty bar cells, app name, and output device

Only standard 16-color SGR codes are used, so everything follows your
terminal's own palette. Prefer plain text? Run
`/media:config statusline.color off` — the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is
honored too.

Every part is also **individually styleable**. Run `/media:style` and say
what you want ("title bold cyan", "bar style wave", "volume icon ♪"), or set
the keys directly. Each key takes any of `bold dim italic underline`, plus
at most one color (`black red green yellow blue magenta cyan white` or
`bright-<color>`) — or `none`:

| key | part | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `style.track.title` / `style.track.artist` | title / artist | `bold` / `italic` |
| `style.app` | app name `(Spotify)` | `dim` |
| `style.time.elapsed` / `style.time.total` | `2:13` / `/4:24` | `bold` / `dim` |
| `style.volume.icon` / `style.volume.bar` / `style.volume.percent` | volume icon / bar / percent | `auto` / `dim` / `dim` |
| `style.progressbar.playing` / `style.progressbar.paused` | bar fill + ▶︎/⏸ accent | `green` / `yellow` |
| `style.progressbar.style` | bar characters | `line` |
| `style.output` | output device | `dim` |

The progress bar's characters come from `style.progressbar.style`: `line`
`━━━━━━────` (default) · `blocks` `██████░░░░` · `wave` `~~~~~~----` · `dots`
`●●●●●●○○○○`, or any two characters meaning "filled + empty" (`"#-"` →
`######----`). The same characters draw the bar in the `/media:now` reply,
so the two surfaces always match. The volume icon (`style.volume.icon`) is
`auto` (🔈/🔉/🔊 tiered by level), `none` (hidden), or any glyph like `♪` —
muted always shows 🔇. Character choices apply even with colors off; the
other keys need `statusline.color` on.

```
/media:config style.track.title "bold cyan"    # set one part
/media:config style.track.title reset          # that part back to its default
/media:config style reset                      # everything back to defaults
```

`media.sh config style` lists every key with its current value and default.
Changes show up on the next statusline tick — no restart needed.

## Step 2 — create the wrapper script

Save as `~/.claude/statusline-media.sh` and make it executable
(`chmod +x ~/.claude/statusline-media.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# statusline-media.sh — existing statusline (verbatim) + now-playing line.
input=$(cat)

# ── 1. Your existing statusLine command, pasted verbatim between the quotes.
#       Take it from the "command" value under "statusLine" in settings.json.
#       Leave EXISTING empty if you had no statusline before.
EXISTING=''
if [ -n "$EXISTING" ]; then
  printf '%s' "$input" | bash -c "$EXISTING"
fi

# ── 2. Now-playing (empty when off / nothing playing / plugin missing).
#       Resolves the newest installed plugin version at run time, so the
#       wrapper survives plugin updates.
MEDIA_DIR="$(ls -d "$HOME"/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-media-control/media/*/ 2>/dev/null \
  | awk -F/ '{ print $(NF-1) "\t" $0 }' \
  | sort -t. -k1,1n -k2,2n -k3,3n \
  | tail -1 | cut -f2-)"
if [ -n "$MEDIA_DIR" ] && [ -x "${MEDIA_DIR}scripts/media.sh" ]; then
  np="$("${MEDIA_DIR}scripts/media.sh" statusline 2>/dev/null)"
  [ -n "$np" ] && printf '%s\n' "$np"
fi
exit 0
```

Developing from a checkout (`claude --plugin-dir`)? Replace the `MEDIA_DIR`
block with your repo path: `np="$(/path/to/claude-media-control/scripts/media.sh statusline 2>/dev/null)"`.

## Step 3 — point settings.json at the wrapper

In `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "\"$HOME/.claude/statusline-media.sh\""
  }
}
```

**Recommended for a live-feeling statusline:** add `"refreshInterval": 1` next
to `"command"`. Statuslines normally refresh on conversation events only, so
while you are idle the elapsed time and progress bar freeze. `refreshInterval`
re-runs the command periodically; `1` (the minimum) pairs with the 1-second
segment cache so the time and bar tick every second. Drop it or raise it if you
prefer fewer redraws (each redraw also re-runs your existing statusline
command).

## Maintenance notes

- The wrapper stores a **copy** of your previous statusline command in
  `EXISTING`. If you later change your statusline setup, update that line
  too.
- To undo everything: restore your old `"statusLine"` value in
  `settings.json` and delete `~/.claude/statusline-media.sh`. Uninstalling
  the plugin makes the segment disappear on its own (the wrapper prints
  nothing when the plugin is gone), but the wrapper file itself is yours to
  remove.
- The segment honors `/media:config display.statusline off` instantly — the
  cached line is deleted on disable, no statusline restart needed.
